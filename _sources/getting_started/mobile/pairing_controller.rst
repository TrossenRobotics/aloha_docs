Pairing Your Controller
=======================

This guide walks you through setting up a Bluetooth joystick controller to control your ALOHA Mobile.

#.  Open the **Settings** menu.

#.  Open the **Bluetooth** settings menu.

#.  Press and hold the **Share** button on the PS4 controller (see image below for reference).

#.  While holding the **Share** button, press and hold the **PS Button**.
    After a few seconds, the triangular shaped LED located between the **L2** and **R2** buttons should start rapidly flashing white (about twice a second) at which point you can let go.

#.  Wait until you see **Wireless Controller** pop up in the Devices menu.
    Select it, and click **Next** on the bottom right of the window.

#.  A message should display saying **successfully set up new device 'Wireless Controller'** and the LED should turn blue.
    This means the controller is connected to the computer.

#.  To disconnect, hold down the **PS Button** for about 10 seconds until the LED turns off.
